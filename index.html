<h1>Music Interests</h1>

    <p>My name is Kiera Robinson and I love music. I listen to all kinds of music, ranging from hip hop, rhythm and blues, dubstep, to rock. My favorite celebrities are Billie Eilish, A$AP Rocky, Lana Del Rey, and Lorde. It’s cooler to listen to different music categories rather than listening to just one. You’ll be able to discuss music with others who have the same music interests as you</p>.

                        <h2>Hobbies</h2>

    <p>In my spare time <I href="https://gohuskies.com/index.aspx?path=softball"> play softball</I>, skateboard, and go outdoors and take aesthetic pictures of nature. I have been playing softball for about ten years and I’m a rookie at skateboarding. I play junior varsity softball at Redmond High School, but I want to make varsity either junior or senior year. Washington state is so beautiful, so I am motivated to take pictures of the breath-taking scenery. When I’m not busy, I like to hang out with my friends at the mall or go out to eat at Red Robin</p>.
